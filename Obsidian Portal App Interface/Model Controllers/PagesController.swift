    URL: http://api.obsidianportal.com/v1/campaigns/campaign_id/wikis.format
    HTTP Verb: GET
    Requires Authentication: Yes
    Required Parameters:

    Notes
    1) Missing fields
    For bandwidth conservation, the data returned does not include the the body, body_html, game_master_info, game_master_info_html fields. If you need the full text, you'll have to request the pages individually.
    
    2) Visibility breakdown
    The list of pages returned depends on the visibility of the campaign and the identity of the logged in user. It breaks down as follows:
    
    public campaign, non-GM - All non gm-only pages
    public campaign, GM - All pages
    private campaign, non-player, non-GM - HTTP 403
    private campaign, player - All non gm-only pages
    private campaign, GM - All pages
